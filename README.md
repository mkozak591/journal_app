# journal_app
Created a journal using html, CSS, and jquery on a flask application. Worked independently for two weeks to create the front-end of a journal so that a user would be able to navigate it by typing, editing, saving, and deleting an entry. Focusing on using this journal for future projects concerning psychology and mental health.
